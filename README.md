There are other alternatives but Coinbase does well in their niche market which is for beginner crypto investors due to their intuitive, easy-to-understand buying options as well as learning options. 


## Recommendations
 
The market is not available in all countries particularly in countries that are not classified as first world which is ironic considering the people who could benefit the most from crypto currencies are ones in countries where the fiat currency is unreliable and the political powers are straining the economy. I think this is where crypto shines the brightest as a way to have a stable currency which also has the safety of not being in government owned banks or in the form of cash. I would highly advise coinbase and all other crypto exchanged to really think about the impact they could have on these countries. The benefit to the company of course would be potentially millions of additional users and may even be adopted by some countries as they become stable or economically more fit. In those countries Coinbase may even have some refuge in taxes. 
 
Also as I have read online the main concern with a lot of customers is the high fees understandably for insurance cost and also for the business model the fees are put in place. However coinbase should look into alternatives and cost cutting methods that may allow people to pay lesser fees with smaller coins. 
 
Finally, continuously update the GUI to make things as easy and seamless as can be.
